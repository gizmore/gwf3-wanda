The spring is about to end.
Still the seven friends practice for the next harvest.
In an appropiate moment, when all but Veronica are busy, Wanda is taking her chance.
«Do you come with us, this afternoon? Into the steppe?», Wanda asks Veronica.
Veronica pauses…
«With pleasure», she says.
«Let's go ask your parents», says Wanda.
She is sure of that;
If Veronica's parents agree, then her parents would agree as well.

Together they start their journey after harvest practice.
As soon as Veronica's parents see the joyful excitement in the four eyes she simply cannot say 'No'.
They promise to be careful and to stay away from ants.
«We didn't even say something about ants!» – thinks Wanda – «And if we meet some by accident, nothing bad will happen…»
Mischievously they look at each other, as they easily start their way into the steppe.

«Ants are difficult to spot» – thinks Wanda.
