The only thing Wanda and her tribe remember is kept in the old chambers and songs.

Wanda can not understand all this yet and is one of many children.
Her parents are very honest and life-loving grasshoppers.
</p>

<p>
They always adhered to the rules of the tribe, <em>without</em> ever questioning them.
In her early days Wanda did not care.
She preferred to play with her friends.
Wanda has a beautiful green skin armor and likes to learn the chirping, how to walk across the fields and how to meet the dangers of the steppe.
She always listens when she talks to the elders, and takes friendly chirping to heart.
At that time, she was still scared.
But they are most frightened by the warnings of the elderly...
