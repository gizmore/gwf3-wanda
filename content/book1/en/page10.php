Winter.
The grasshoppers in the Sahel are very fine.
The tribe of the 'Fraviers' are the finest again.
Wanda, Veronica, Olivia and Marcy enjoy themself in their shelter.
Today they invented a new game.
They throw harvested stalks into the air and try to catch them with their mouth.

Vernoica, as always, pushes it too far and fells.
All are laughing together.

In the hideout it is nicely warm, and the haystackâ€¦ oh well, the haystack.

There is no way that Wanda could repair it; And it will resist for eternity anyway, so it looks like.
Sadly Wanda is thinking of the summer son, and her ant.
