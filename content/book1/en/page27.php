The little ones have lots of free time now.
The harvest has been carried in, and almost all grasshoppers sleep the most of the day.
Michelle, Carolin and Alexandra now meet guys, as they want to discuss Wanda's transport plan.
This summer, Veronica, Olivia, Maice and Wanda often 'go out', so they call it.
That Wanda is looking for ants, and Veronica wants to walk to the oasis, they do not reveal.
«We're going to play outside», say the four, and their parents agree.

Marcy and Olivia are satisfied that they can support the clique.
Meanwhile, the four venture out far.
Past the dunes, overgrown white skeletons, and some flowers here and there.
The oasis is still far away.
Big haystacks, the human hideouts, are rare meanwhile.
No more noise is heard out of them.
Where are the people now?
Wanda, who is now slightly annoyed, thinks that she has not seen a single ant.
Whether they are gone?
