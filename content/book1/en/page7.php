Wanda shivers and awakes near her friends.
Cold dew is putting the steppe and the haystack to gloom.

Quickly, the four friends are heading to the lair.
Wanda's head is spinning with the thoughts from yesterday.
She wished she could celebrate again, like yesterday, so freely, until one fells asleep with their friends beneath the stars.
Veronica agrees.

After the daily work they decide to visit the haystack again.
Wanda examins it, and notices quite some brittle on one of the sides.
What should the four friends do?
Notify the others of the damage?
Ultimately they decide to search for own fields, and so they started to explore the steppe together.

<p>
The lions look angry, and the vultures circle,
but together, Veronica and Wanda have no fear.
Anyway, after a few hours they give up.
Fields are not to be found.
Wanda wished it would be summer every day.
