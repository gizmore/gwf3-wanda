Wanda is confused.
For her most important questions she always gets the same boring answers.
</p>

<p>

«Why aren't i allowed to watch the apes?» – ponders Wanda – «And why can't i talk to the zebras?»
Apes are dirty, and zebras step on your head, is the answer.
And when Wanda asks, why the grasshoppers always eat all of the fields, then the answer is mostly:
«Darling, things are the way they are!»

Only her family and closest friends take her serious.
Sadly, her ideas not.
Wanda has to think of the eyes of the ants again,
and gets hungry…
