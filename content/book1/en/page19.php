But on her own Wanda does not want to look for ants.
She asks her best friends if they want to come along.
Olivia and Maice look confused: «You know we can not do that?»
Maice nods, and Veronica agrees.
«And if we're very careful?» Wanda asks.
The four friends are at a loss ...

<p>
«Screw it.», says Wanda, and gives Veronica a secret wink.
This day, the seven quickly find something else to spend their time.
They try to put stalks into each other that it reveals a pattern.
Everyone alone, but alltogether, they are playing with the stalks..

<p>
This day will be never forgotten.
</p>

<p>
In the evening they get caught by an elderly grasshopper: «You are not allowed to play with the stalks. Else i knot your antennas together.»
Quickly the group flees in all directions.

Wanda thinks of Veronica, who has to cross the haystack on her way home.
«If she understood my wink?»
«I will ask her again when we are alone.» – thinks Wanda.

<p>
In her daydreams she is at her ant.
