Today is the day.
The first time this spring, the four explore the steppe again.
Wanda is excited.
As far as the eye can look, everything is harvested.
Dead animals can be found here and there, and Wanda does not know what she should think of that.
Today they do not walk far.
They stop as they see huge buildings.
Such has never been seen before.

<p>
The buildings look like haystacks, but get very thin at the top. 
Stalks are not in there, as it seems from far behind, but there are sounds like those from a hungry lion.
Freightened the friends turn around and walk home.
On their way home they see a young zebra.
It is very thin. A harpy is crying in the distance.
And Wanda…
uselessly looks out…
for an ant.
