Wanda has to report to someone what she had seen.
What she has seen was way too impressive.
So Wanda runs to her mother and reports excitedly.
</p>

<p>
«You have been in the steppe again? alone?!», shouts her mother, «Who do you think you are?!»
«Ants?!» – «Child! Haven't i told you that you shall stay away from the ants?!»
«Ants are a bad company!»

Wanda believes what her mom says and later tells it to Olivia.
Olivia explains that ants look for food that way.
They orientate on the scent of other ants, lay a trail, which other ants follow.
Wanda nicks.
</p>

<p>
What ants do with their food, and what they eat, is also of interest to her.
But Olivia talks so much that Wanda has no opportunity to ask.
This day Wanda learnt a lot.
