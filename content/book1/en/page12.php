Spring announces itself, and Wanda can hardly wait to explore the steppe further.
Of course, she hopes to see an ant again.
«You must not go out today,» Veronica's mother scolds.
Veronica and Wanda give up.
Tomorrow is another day, and there is plenty to do elseway.
However, it is a bit annoying that Veronica's mother is always so strict with them.
How is Veronica supposed to get to know the steppe?

Huh... how big is the Sahel anyway?
«How far would Veronica go, if they were allowed to, tommorow?» – thinks Wanda.
The winter passed quickly, so Wanda and her tribe hope for a long spring.

Wanda goes to bed early and has a dream that night;
She dreams of a hungry ant.
When she wakes up, she immediately wants to go out in the steppe, meet an and, and ask her lots of questions.
Wanda's head is always full of questions.
«Don't annoy me.», her mother often said.
But Wanda does not want to annoy.
Although… not asking questions…
This is no option for Wanda!
