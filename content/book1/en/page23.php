It is midsummer.
The seven friends had trained studiously for the upcoming harvest.
Wanda thinks that Veronica eventually became a master in cutting bigg.
The leafs loudly rustle when she climbs the stalk up and down.
Olivia and Marcy are also a good team, if you have to cut a plain stalk into smaller pieces.
Wanda's idea with folding the stalks was not a good one,
but the experiment with the braiding, so her grandma calls it, has been quite succesful for stacking the stalks.
It takes some time, but Alexandra, Caroline and Michelle can transport the stalks without problems.

The harvest should turn out better this year for the kids, so the seven do think.
They are working well together and are looking forward to the challenge.
Wanda considers why males strictly have to build the hideeout and don't have to help during the harvest.
For the transportation, a few strong males would be of use.
Veronica lets rain a few leaves.…
«Don't dream again, Wanda!», she shouts from above.

Wanda looks up and smiles.
