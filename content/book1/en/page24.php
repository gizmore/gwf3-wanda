The harvest is very close.
Wanda and Veronica look for the haystack once again.
Meanwhile it is empty.
Veronica suggests to go to the other side of the hideout.
There the haystacks should still contain some stalks.
The two begin to walk their way.
</p>

<p>
Wanda is suprised;
So many and large haystacks are unexpected.
They are even more crackled than those near Wanda's home.
Quickly Veronica und Wanda take a few stalks and hopple away.

<p>
Back at her little haystack they nibble the stalks, watch the sky and are looking forward to the next big harvest.
</p>

<p>
Back home, Wanda is in trouble again.
«Who allowed you to take stalks of the eastern haystack?!», asks Jessica, another grandma of Wanda. <!-- Jess! ;) -->
«No one…», answers Wanda, blushes, and silently looks downwards.
Wanda is sent to her room and may not take part at the daily supper for two days.
</p>

<p>
Angry and sad she goes to bed and thinks…
«Who had seen us at the haystack?»
«Why aren't Veronica and I not allowed to eat a single stalk in silence in the evening?!»
«I don't want to be a grasshopper…»
</p>

<p>
Wanda is crying herself to sleep.
