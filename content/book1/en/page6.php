All in the tribe fill their waists, drink the water of the earth, and laugh about the other animals.
Wanda does the same with her friends, her family and their comrades.
Nothing is kept unspoken.

That what has been painted has been washed away, but that didn't matter.
What they had experienced this summer, they would never ever forget.

A beautiful summer.
