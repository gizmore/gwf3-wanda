The spring is wonderful, and the most time is spent by the friends outside, under protection of the tribe.
On the playground they find new friends who follow happily.
Caroline is a bit heavy and laughs with joy.
Michelle is a bit slow, but has a pure heart.
The small group has thus grown to six grasshoppers.

Wanda is now also striving alone from time to time,
and one day her passion is fulfiled.
She sees an ant. Her ant.

It seems to live in a hole and carries a lot of things in and out;
Leaves, Stones, and other things, which she cannot recognize from far behind.
The ant always seems to look callous and cold, whenever Wanda looks at it.
«Are ants really so evil as her grandma told?» – Wanda thinks a bit freightened.
She would love to ask, but the ant seems very busy.
What is her name?
