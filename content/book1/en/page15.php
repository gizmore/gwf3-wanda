Today Wanda is really brave.
Early in the morning, she sneaks to the ant hills, and…
waits…
</p>

<p>
After some time, the first ants ripple out of their hill.
Wanda wants to say something, but the ants look all alike to her.
She cannot remember exactly which ant had this stare glaze look, or if she ever will recognize her special ant again.

<p>
Slowly wanda backs up.
She is alienated.
Should she just talk to a random ant.
Ants do not look <em>that</em> evil.
At least if you take a close look.
Wanda got so many questions for the ants.
If she just could ask a direct question and would get a clean answer.
Which question would she choose, if she had just only one.
</p>

<p>
Wanda is overwhelmed.
Only a few minutes she was lost in thoughts and suddenly there are countless ants to be seen at the hill.
They run left and right and in all directions into the distance.
Wanda decides to go home.
Back to her tribe.
<em>The Fraviers.</em>
