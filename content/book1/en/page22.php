Wanda's parents wait impatiently for her coming home.
From far they look angry, but the closer they come to the hideout, the happier they appear to be.
Relaxation. <!-- Laxity -->
Her parents greet Wanda kind but decisive.
«We were crazy for sorrow.», 
«Where have you been?!».
«Is Veronica back home?», they ask.
Wanda answers all questions…
«We will take care!!»
«We just walked a little in the suns direction.»
«NO! WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ANTS!»
At supper Wanda retells more of what happened on their way.

As Wanda talks over the oasis, the elderly listen thoughtfully, but also this sorrow gets distracted.
«Don't worry.», says Famoso, an eldery gray mantis, «The zebras are watching over this.»
Wanda breathes a sign of relief; If the elderly even know about the oasis, then they will also know about the haystack, and she does not even need to mention it.

<!-- Famoso is named after Mr.Monk FamStar -->

After the meal Wanda lays in bed awake and lets her thoughts soar.
She totally wanted to meet an ant today.
