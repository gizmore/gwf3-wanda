Wanda had been told about the harvest a lot, but she never needed to help.
Although she is prepared well, her help is required the first time in her life, and she almost can't sleep of joy.
Neither she is tired only a tiny bit.
There are no problems in her life, and now her greatest day will comeâ€¦
</p>
<p>
Her first task is easy;
She and her friends shall harvest the little field in the center of the harvest area.

Happily they lope to work in the golden shiny fields.
Veronica is taking care of the small leaves, Olivia and Marcy cut the thicker stalks, and Wanda kindly is picking up the work of the others, watching her environment and spectated animals she never noticed before.
It had six legs, two antennas, was black, and had cold mindless look in the eyes.

For a moment, Wanda felt lost.
Before the friends were finished, the day was over, the steppe cut, and the only field that hadn't been harvest throughout the land, was that of the youngsters.
This means trouble.
