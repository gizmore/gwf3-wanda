The harvest has been a big disappointment for Wanda again.
The middle Field, for the kids, has not been completed, even though it was as small as last year.
Again, the elders had to help, and again, the Sahel offers a sad look after the harvest.

At the harvest celelbration all overdo the party again.
As last year, Harald sounds big: "They will have bad cards.", and laughs.
The women, as always, take care of fresh water, fresh stalks, and the kids.
After the meal, our friends go back to their little haystack.
The stars glow brightly.
In the distance hyenas cry, and the whole tribe chirps as if there were no tomorrow.</p>

Wanda is happy and wonders how the ants are.
«Now in the naked summer i will see my ant again» – thinks Wanda.
The haystack is creeking as the seven friends fall asleep under the starlit sky.
