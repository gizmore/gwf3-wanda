The winter is bitterly cold, and the hideout is almost too small for that many grasshoppers.
«Luckily!», says Wanda's grandma, «this way we can keep each other warm.»
This thought gives Wanda a headache.

<p>
More and more grasshoppers, and more and more hideout, but nobody thinks of the haystack.
In the afternoon Veronica and Wanda hopple back to look at the haystack's damage again.
The small crackles are still there and the haystack is well filled.

Today for lazy lying it is too cold, so the four gather at home and read the paintings which are required by the elderly.
The reading is enjoyed by all of them.
Soon, Wanda is lying in bed, reading her first big book, all on her own.
She loves the challenge, and the more she reads, the easier it becomes.
Her parents are very proud of Wanda, and she feels great in her role.

«Oh my, if only all animals could feel this good…» – thinks Wanda.
She ponders, how it would be, to be an ant.
But she is not allowed to talk to evil ants.
